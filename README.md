Human Pose estimation
Human pose estimation has always been a challenging problem especially in the detection of human joints in various body poses in order to get a posture frame. This trend leads to several architectures and models that are computationally expensive and require costly  pre-training of datasets  and hardware equipments, also it leads problem in comparing other techniques with replicate existing outcomes. Therefore, to resolve this issue, this paper,  discusses the challenges faced in   detecting human joints and give an overview of the substantial research  work done in this area.  In this paper an efficient CNN-based regression model has been developed that can easily be trained on mid-run kaggle GPU towards estimation of body keypoints and identifying the joints that results in low loss value , for the estimation of the MPII dataset and its sub-regions. This technique shows consistent improvement over the dataset where the data was curated and crafted as per the needs. The dataset images were cropped to increase the focus on the humans in the images. This paper modifies the images excluding the not required  background details, thus only training the human body image pixels in the proposed network. The paper also shows the results obtained by the proposed model with the modelled dataset.
